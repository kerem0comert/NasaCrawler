<p>Each photo has its view model, defined to keep in line with the MVVM Architecture Pattern.
This provides safety in cases of app's variables being killed in Fragment's lifecycles and
low memory conditions. It also creates another layer between the view and the data, as it would
be bad practice to let Fragment handle the state of the data. As Google advises, the Fragment and
Activity classes should only be concerned with user interactions.</p>
